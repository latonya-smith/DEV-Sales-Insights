# DEV-Sales-Insights

AtliQ Hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware & peripheral manufacturer for multiple stores. They serve multiple company stores such as Surge Stores, Nomad Stores, Excel Stores and Electica Stores.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
There is a Sales Director that oversees multiple regional directors of this company. However, after a quarterly report, he found that sales for the company are declining. In an effort to get a sense of the problem, he asked the managers for data about the products, sales and customers. These datasets, however offered only numbers, not the insight that we wanted. From the information provided he wanted to know these things:

1. Revenue breakdown by cities
2. Revenue breakdown by years and months
3. Show me top 5 customers by revenue and sales quantity
4. Top 5 products by revenue number
5. Visualization is better than numbers.

The contents of this project are:
1. SQL script used to explore the data
1. Tableau Project file containing the resulting dashboard
